# drums_in_a_solar_system
Solar system made using processing connected to pure data patches using oscP5 and NetP5. 
The drums uses samples that are in the folder ***Hhopkit***. There is a bonus song ***gangnam style*** that once played in 
pure data and the line 55 uncommented ( ***stars.makeStars()*** ) in solar_sytem's method draw(), the the stars react to the
frequency of the sound. 

The line 47 in **solar_sytem.pde** applies a background image. Instead of the image you can use a custom made stars
by commenting this line and uncommenting the line 55.

This project is mixed with different techniques mainly a lot of geometry in the processing code and various techniques in
pure data that everyone should enjoy.
